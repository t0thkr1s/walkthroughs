After inspecting the output, I quickly found a public exploit: https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/wp_crop_rce/

I used a `python` oneliner to get a pseudo TTY shell:

```
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

The privilege escalation part was fairly straightforward. I found a binary with SUID bit set and it checked for and environment variable called `admin`. It doesn't validate the value, so you can export the variable with an arbitrary value.
