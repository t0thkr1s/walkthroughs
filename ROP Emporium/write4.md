# write4

On completing our usual checks for interesting strings and symbols in this binary we're confronted with the stark truth that our favourite string `/bin/cat flag.txt` is not present this time. Although you'll see later that there are other ways around this problem, such as resolving dynamically loaded libraries and using the strings present in those, we'll stick to the challenge goal which is learning how to get data into the target process's virtual address space via the magic of ROP.


## Read & Write

The important thing to realise is that ROP is just a form of arbitrary code execution and if we're creative we can leverage it to do things like write to or read from memory. The question is what mechanism are we going to use to solve this problem, is there any built-in functionality to do the writing or do we need to use gadgets? In this challenge we won't be using built-in functionality since that's too similar to the previous challenges, instead we'll be looking for gadgets that let us write a value to memory such as `mov [reg], reg`. Nonetheless it is possible to solve this challenge by leveraging functions like `fgets()` to write to memory locations of your choosing so it's worth trying to do it that way once you've solved it using the intended technique.


## What & Where

Perhaps the most important thing to consider in this challenge is __where__ we're going to write our string. Use rabin2 or readelf to check out the different sections of this binary and their permissions. Learn a little about ELF sections and their purpose. Consider how much space each section might give you to work with and whether corrupting the information stored at these locations will cause you problems later if you need some kind of stability from this binary.


## Decisions, decisions

Once you've figured out how to write your string into memory and where to write it, go ahead and call `system()` with its location as your only argument. Are you going to cat flag.txt or drop a shell with `/bin/sh`? Try to wrap some of your functionality in helper functions, if you can write a 4 or 8 byte value to a location in memory, can you craft a function (in python using pwntools for example) that takes a string and a memory location and returns a ROP chain that will write that string to your chosen location? Crafting templates like this will make your life much easier in the long run.


There are indeed three very different ways to solve the 64 bit version of this challenge, including the intended method. Built-in functionality will give you a win if you're willing to borrow a technique from the 'pivot' challenge and an oversight in how the `pwnme()` function was constructed can get you a shell in a single link chain ðŸ¤«

Checking the `sym.usefulFunction` reveals that there's a systemcall, but it calls `/bin/ls`. So the goal is to write `/bin/sh\x00` somewhere in the binary, and use the `system()` to execute the string.

## Checking Section Permissions

As you can see, we have read and write permissions on the `.data` section.

It looks the binary is passing `/bin/ls` to the `system()` function call.

Now we have to find gadgets that will allow us to place that string into the section. Iâ€™m going to use `ropper` once again.


```
t0thkr1s@darlene ~/Downloads> ropper -f write4 --search 'pop rdi'
[INFO] Load gadgets from cache
[LOAD] loading... 100%
[LOAD] removing double gadgets... 100%
[INFO] Searching for gadgets: pop rdi

[INFO] File: write4
0x0000000000400893: pop rdi; ret; 

t0thkr1s@darlene ~/Downloads>
```

But what exactly are we looking for? Firstly, we have to find a gadget that will place value at memory address. In assembly this operation looks like this `MOV [R0], R1`, which directly translates to move value from register `R1` to memory at address held by register `R0`.
The best candidate would gadget at address `0x0000000000400820` which is `mov qword ptr [r14], r15; ret;` So we can now place a value into memory, but we also need to place values into these registers with `pop`, which we can do with this gadget `pop r14; pop r15; ret;` at addtess `0x0000000000400890`. Now to finally finish collecting addresses, we have to come back and get the address of system() and in order to place the address of the string as the argument to this call, pop rdi will be needed. This gadget can be found at address 0x0000000000400893.

Great, now we can start writing our exploit.

Use `pop` gadget to place the address of our string, and string in registers
Use `mov` gadget to place the string into the memory at provided address
Use `pop rdi` gadget to place the address of the string into register.
Call address of `system()` which uses `rdi` as the argument register holding address of our string.
